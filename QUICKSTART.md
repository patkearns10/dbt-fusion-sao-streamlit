## Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
- Make sure you installed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use `python3 -m streamlit` not just `streamlit`

**Can't connect to dbt Cloud?**
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check Account ID is correct
- Ensure API key has proper permissions

**Run analysis is slow?**
- Start with 5-10 runs
- Reduce date range to 7 days
- Each run requires ~3 API calls
