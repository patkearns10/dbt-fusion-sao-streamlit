# Changelog

## [2.9.0] - November 28, 2025

### Major Feature: Enhanced SAO Adoption Analysis 🎯

Added comprehensive State-Aware Orchestration (SAO) adoption analysis to the **Environment Overview** tab to help organizations understand and optimize their SAO usage.

#### New SAO Adoption Section

**Overall Metrics & Visualizations:**
- Total Jobs, SAO-Enabled Jobs, and Non-SAO Jobs metrics

- Scheduled jobs-specific analysis with dedicated pie chart and metrics

**Job Type Breakdown (New!):**
- Grouped bar chart comparing SAO adoption across CI, Merge, Scheduled, and Other job types
- Summary table with counts and percentages by job type
- Smart alerts for low adoption in critical job types (CI and Merge jobs)

**Freshness Configuration Coverage (New!):**
- 4 key metrics tracking configuration patterns:
  - ✅ Both SAO & Freshness (optimal)
  - ⚠️ SAO without Freshness (may not reuse effectively)
  - 💡 Freshness without SAO (missing optimization)
  - ❌ Neither (basic configuration)
- Color-coded bar chart showing configuration distribution
- Expandable lists of jobs with problematic configurations
- Helps identify misconfigured jobs that won't benefit from SAO

**Top Opportunities Analysis (New!):**
- Intelligent ranking of non-SAO jobs by potential impact
- Impact Score calculation: `Recent Runs × Avg Duration (minutes)`
- Priority levels: High (CI/Merge), Medium (Scheduled), Low (Other)
- Top 10 table with color-coded text by priority (red/orange/gray)
- ROI calculator showing estimated time savings if SAO enabled
- Helps prioritize which jobs to enable SAO on first

**All Jobs List:**
- Expandable table showing all jobs with SAO status (✅/❌)
- Includes Job ID, Name, Type, and Environment ID
- Sorted by SAO status then job name

#### Visual Enhancements

### Model Details Tab Enhancements 📋

**Project/Package Filtering (New!):**
- Multiselect filter to show models from specific projects/packages
- Helps focus on main project vs. external dependencies
- Default: All projects selected

**Project/Package Column:**
- Added "Project/Package" column to the results table
- Clearly shows which project each model belongs to
- Useful for identifying cross-project references

**Group by Project/Package (New!):**
- Optional checkbox to group results by project
- Each project displayed in expandable section with:
  - Project name and item count
  - Project-specific metrics (Total Items, With Freshness, Coverage %)
  - Filtered table for that project
- All sections expanded by default for easy scanning
- Makes it easy to compare freshness coverage across projects

### Cost Analysis Tab Improvements 💰

**Removed:**
- Cost Distribution by Status chart (redundant - only showed that reused = $0)

### Bug Fixes & Polish 🔧

**Top Opportunities Table:**
- Changed from background highlighting to colored text with bold font
- Much more readable: Red (High), Orange (Medium), Gray (Low)
- Rounded decimal places from 6+ to 2 digits

**All Files:**

## [2.8.6] - November 26, 2025

### Critical Bug Fix: API Limit Pagination 📊

#### Problem
API calls were failing with **"Limit must not exceed 100"** error when trying to fetch more than 100 runs:
```
Response: {"status": {"code": 400, "is_success": false, 
          "user_message": "Limit must not exceed 100", ...}
```

#### Root Cause
The code was calculating `fetch_limit = min(200, max_runs * 3)` to account for date filtering, which could result in requests like:
- User sets slider to 54 runs
- Code calculates: `54 * 3 = 162` runs
- API request: `limit=162` ❌ (exceeds max of 100)

#### Solution
Implemented **automatic pagination** when limit exceeds 100:
- Split large requests into multiple API calls
- Each call limited to max 100 runs
- Uses `offset` parameter to fetch subsequent pages
- Works for both single and multiple status filters

#### Code Changes
```python
# Before
params = {'limit': limit, ...}  # Could be > 100 ❌

# After
API_MAX_LIMIT = 100
while runs_to_fetch > 0:
    page_limit = min(runs_to_fetch, API_MAX_LIMIT)
    params = {'limit': page_limit, 'offset': offset, ...}
    # Fetch page, increment offset, repeat ✅
```

#### Also Fixed
- Enhanced error logging now shows API response body
- Made it clear that `environment_id` is not needed with `job_definition_id`

**Result:** ✅ Can now fetch up to 240 runs (80 * 3) across multiple API calls!

---

## [2.8.5] - November 26, 2025

### Critical Bug Fix: Trailing Slash in API Base URL 🔧

#### Problem
400 errors were occurring due to **double slashes** in API URLs:
```
https://vu491.us1.dbt.com//api/v2/...  ❌ (double slash)
                        ^^
```

#### Root Cause
When users entered the API base URL with a trailing slash:
- Input: `https://vu491.us1.dbt.com/`
- Code adds: `/api/v2/...`
- Result: `https://vu491.us1.dbt.com//api/v2/...` ❌

#### Solution
- **Auto-strip trailing slashes** when saving configuration
- Updated help text to show correct format examples
- Now handles URLs with or without trailing slashes

#### Code Change
```python
# Before
'api_base': api_base,  # Could have trailing slash

# After
'api_base': api_base.rstrip('/'),  # Always clean
```

#### Also Improved
- **Better error messages** when status API calls fail
- Surfaces errors to user instead of failing silently
- Shows which specific status failed and why

**Result:** ✅ Works with any URL format! No more double slash errors!

## [2.8.4] - November 26, 2025

### Critical Fix: Multiple Status API Calls 🚀

#### Fixed: Proper Multi-Status Filtering

**The Issue:**
- dbt Cloud API only accepts **one `status` value per request**
- Passing multiple statuses like `?status=10&status=20` causes 400 errors
- Previous fix (v2.8.3) fetched all runs and filtered client-side (inefficient)

**The Solution:**
- **Make separate API calls** for each status
- Combine results and remove duplicates
- Sort by most recent
- Much more efficient than fetching all runs!

**How It Works:**
```python
# For Success + Error:
# Call 1: GET /runs/?status=10&environment_id=672
# Call 2: GET /runs/?status=20&environment_id=672
# Combine results → return most recent runs
```

**Example:**
- User selects: Success (10) + Error (20)
- Makes 2 API calls: one for status=10, one for status=20
- Combines and returns up to `limit` most recent runs
- ✅ Fast, efficient, accurate!

**Also Fixed:**
- Now using `environment_id` parameter instead of `project_id`
- Both work, but `environment_id` is more semantically correct
- Updated all `get_job_runs()` calls throughout the app

**Affected Tabs:**
- ✅ Model Details
- ✅ Historical Trends
- ✅ Cost Analysis

**Performance:**
- Much faster than fetching all runs
- Only fetches what's needed
- Minimal API overhead (typically 1-3 calls)

---

## [2.8.3] - November 26, 2025

### Critical Bug Fix 🚨

#### Fixed: 400 Bad Request Error with Multiple Status Filters

**Error:**
```
400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: 
https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/.../runs/?...&status=10&status=20
```

**Root Cause:**
- dbt Cloud API doesn't support multiple `status` query parameters in a single request
- When selecting multiple run statuses (e.g., Success + Error), the API call failed

**Solution (Temporary - improved in v2.8.4):**
- Changed from server-side to client-side filtering
- Fetch all runs without status filter
- Filter by status after receiving the data

**Result:** ✅ Multi-status filtering works (but improved in v2.8.4)

---

## [2.8.2] - November 26, 2025

### Bug Fixes & Improvements 🐛

#### Historical Trends Tab - Fixed Run Filtering Logic

**Problem:** 
- Runs were being limited by the slider BEFORE date filtering
- This caused confusing messages like "Found 12 runs" followed by "No runs found in date range"
- When increasing the slider, more runs would appear because more were fetched before the date filter

**Solution:**
- Now fetches 3x the slider limit (up to 200 runs) from API
- Applies date filtering first
- Counts total runs in date range
- Then limits to slider value
- Shows clear message: "Found X runs in date range, analyzing Y most recent (limited by slider)"

**Example Messages:**
- Before: `✅ Found 12 runs. Analyzing in parallel...` (confusing)
- After: `✅ Found 45 runs in date range, analyzing 12 most recent (limited by slider)...` (clear!)

#### Slider Max Value Increased
- **Historical Trends**: Max runs increased from 50 → 80
- Allows analysis of larger time periods
- Still benefits from parallel processing

#### Fixed Column Mismatch Error
**Error:** `ValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 13 elements, new values have 10 elements`

**Cause:** Added job_id, job_name, run_status_name columns but didn't update column name mapping

**Fix:** Updated column names list to include:
- 'Job ID'
- 'Job Name'  
- 'Run Status'

Now the Detailed Run Breakdown table displays correctly with all columns!

### Technical Details

#### Fetch Strategy
```python
# Old: Limited before date filtering
limit=max_runs  # Could be 10

# New: Fetch more to account for filtering
fetch_limit = min(200, max_runs * 3)  # Could be 30-200
```

#### Filtering Flow
1. Fetch runs (3x slider or 200 max)
2. **Filter by date range** ← Now happens before limiting!
3. Filter by SAO (if enabled)
4. Count total
5. Limit to slider max
6. Show accurate message

#### Benefits
- ✅ No more confusing "found but not found" messages
- ✅ Date filtering works correctly regardless of slider value
- ✅ Clear visibility into how many runs exist vs. being analyzed
- ✅ Slider tooltip updated: "Maximum number of runs to analyze (from total found)"

- **skipped**: Now grey (#9ca3af) for clarity
- **Impact**: Much easier to interpret status distributions at a glance

#### Detailed Run Breakdown - Enhanced Context
**NEW: Job Information in Run Table**
- Added **Job ID** column
- Added **Job Name** column  
- Added **Run Status** column (success, error, cancelled)
- **Impact**: Better traceability from runs back to source jobs

#### Job Overlap Analysis - Smarter Handling
**NEW: Currently Running Jobs**
- Now **fetches latest successful run** instead of skipping
- Shows count of running jobs using successful run data
- **Before**: "⚠️ 2 jobs skipped: 1 currently running"
- **After**: "ℹ️ 1 job(s) currently running - using latest successful run"
- **Impact**: More complete analysis, no waiting for jobs to finish

**NEW: Jobs Summary Table**
- Now shows table of all analyzed jobs **even when no overlap found**
- Displays: Job Name, Job ID, Run ID, Model Count
- Sorted by model count (descending)
- **Impact**: Always see what was analyzed, not just problems

### Technical Implementation

#### `process_single_run()` Function
- Added `job_id`, `job_name`, `run_status` parameters
- Returns job context with model data
- Enables richer analysis across tabs

#### Job Overlap Logic
- Removed skip logic for currently running jobs
- Fetches latest successful run as fallback
- Only skips jobs with no successful run history

#### Status Colors Map
```python
status_colors = {
    'success': '#22c55e',  # green
    'error': '#ef4444',    # red
    'reused': '#60a5fa',   # light blue
    'skipped': '#9ca3af'   # grey
}
```

## [2.8.0] - November 26, 2025

### 🎯 Major Overhaul - Step-Based Run Analysis & Accurate Model Counting

#### Revolutionary New Approach: Step-Based Run Processing

**Problem Identified:**
- Jobs with multiple steps (e.g., `dbt build` + `dbt compile`) were causing inaccurate model counts
- The final `dbt compile` step would compile ALL models and show them as "success" with near-zero execution time
- Heuristic-based detection was creating false positives and confusion

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Intelligent Step Filtering**: Only analyze `dbt run` and `dbt build` commands
- **Multi-Step Aggregation**: Fetch and combine `run_results.json` from all relevant steps
- **Zero Guesswork**: No more heuristics - just accurate data from actual run/build steps

#### Technical Implementation (`log_freshness.py`)

##### New Methods
1. **`fetch_run_steps()`**
   - Fetches run steps from API with `include_related=["run_steps"]`
   - Filters to only steps containing "dbt run" or "dbt build"
   - Skips auxiliary commands (deps, compile, docs, source freshness, etc.)
   - Returns list of relevant step indices

2. **`fetch_run_results(step)`**
   - Enhanced to accept optional `step` parameter
   - Fetches `run_results.json?step={N}` for specific steps
   - Backwards compatible (no step = default behavior)

3. **`aggregate_run_results_from_steps()`**
   - Orchestrates the new step-based approach
   - Fetches run_results.json from all relevant steps
   - Aggregates model statuses across steps
   - Handles duplicates (model in multiple steps)
   - Falls back gracefully if no relevant steps found

4. **`_aggregate_results()`**
   - Merges results from multiple steps
   - Tracks which steps each model appeared in
   - Prioritizes error > success > reused for status resolution
   - Prints detailed diagnostics

5. **`_process_single_run_results()`**
   - Clean fallback method for single run_results.json
   - No log parsing, no heuristics
   - Used when step-based approach fails

##### Updated Methods
- **`process_run_statuses()`**: Now a thin wrapper that calls `aggregate_run_results_from_steps()`
- **Removed**: All log parsing logic, fuzzy detection heuristics, execution time guessing

#### Application Updates (`streamlit_freshness_app.py`)

##### Run Status Filtering 🎚️
**NEW: Filter runs by completion status across all tabs**

- **Filter Options**: Success, Error, Cancelled
- **Default**: Success only (most common use case)
- **Multi-select**: Analyze multiple statuses simultaneously
- **Applied To**: Model Details, Historical Trends, Cost Analysis

##### Tab-by-Tab Enhancements

**📋 Model Details**
- Added run status filtering (Success/Error/Cancelled)
- Uses new step-based approach for accurate counts
- Shows run status in info message
- Better error messages with status context

**📈 Historical Trends**
- Run status multi-select filter
- Step-based analysis for all runs
- Removed "Data Quality Notice" warning (no longer needed!)
- Accurate model counts regardless of job structure
- Status codes properly passed to API

**💰 Cost Analysis**
- Run status filtering support
- Accurate cost calculations using step-based data
- No more inflated model counts from compile steps
- True savings calculations

**🔀 Job Overlap Analysis**
- Updated to use step-based artifact fetching
- Only counts models from run/build steps
- Avoids duplicate counting from compile steps
- More accurate overlap detection

#### API Enhancements

**`get_job_runs()` Function**
- NEW `status` parameter: List of status codes to filter by
- Supports multiple statuses via API (10=success, 20=error, 30=cancelled)
- Backwards compatible (status=None = all statuses)
- Proper type hints with `List[int]`

#### What This Fixes

1. **✅ Accurate Model Counts**
   - Before: Job with 1 model executed showed 1736 "success" (from dbt compile)
   - After: Shows exactly 1 model executed, correct status breakdown

2. **✅ No More False Positives**
   - Eliminated all heuristic-based guessing
   - No execution time thresholds
   - No log parsing failures

3. **✅ Multi-Step Job Support**
   - Correctly handles jobs with multiple dbt commands
   - Aggregates data from all relevant steps
   - Ignores auxiliary commands (compile, docs, etc.)

4. **✅ Better User Experience**
   - Removed confusing "Data Quality Notice" warnings
   - Clear, accurate metrics
   - Trustworthy data for decision-making

5. **✅ Flexible Status Analysis**
   - Analyze successful runs, errors, or cancelled runs
   - Compare patterns across status types
   - Debug failed runs more effectively

#### Breaking Changes
- None! The changes are backwards compatible and transparent to users

#### Performance
- Minimal impact (1-2 additional API calls per run to fetch steps)
- Parallel processing still active in Historical Trends
- Smart fallback to default run_results.json if needed

#### Example: Step Filtering

**Skipped Steps:**
- `Clone git repository`
- `Create profile from connection`
- `Invoke dbt with dbt deps`
- `Invoke dbt with dbt source freshness`
- `Invoke dbt with Generation of docs`
- `Invoke dbt with dbt compile` ⚠️ (this was the culprit!)

**Analyzed Steps:**
- ✅ `Invoke dbt with dbt build --exclude package:dbt_project_evaluator`
- ✅ `Invoke dbt with dbt run --select tag:hourly`

#### Migration Notes
- No user action required
- Existing functionality unchanged
- Data will be more accurate automatically
- Previous inaccuracies will self-correct on next analysis
